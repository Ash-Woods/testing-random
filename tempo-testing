I'm creating this to attempt to track the tempo plugin for JetBrains IDE PyCharm.

Testing with example jira instance pmoideation first.





Ok I'm now trying this process from VSC as I was finding that PyCharm was only including the Activity: Pycharm? Now I tried this and still only get the VSC in the Activity now. I might have to log a ticket to be honest.
